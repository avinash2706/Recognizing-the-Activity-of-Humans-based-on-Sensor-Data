# Recognizing the Activity of Humans based on Sensor Data


The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone.

- Implemented Machine learning models like RBF Kernel based SVM, GradientBoostedDT, LinearSVC etc.
- Used Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Support for Classification report.
- Implemented GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter tuning.
