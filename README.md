# Recognizing the Activity of Humans based on Sensor Data


The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying. All the data is from sensors that detect the motion of humans.

- Implemented Machine learning models like RBF Kernel based SVM, GradientBoostedDT, LinearSVC etc.
- Used Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Support for Classification report.
- Implemented GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter tuning.
